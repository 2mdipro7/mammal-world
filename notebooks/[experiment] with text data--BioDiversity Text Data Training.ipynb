belangeri\n","The Northern Treeshrew (Tupaia belangeri) is a small mammal species found in various parts of Southeast Asia, including India. Recognizable by their unique appearance and arboreal habits, treeshrews are known for their ecological roles and distinct behaviors.Northern Treeshrews have a body length ranging from about 12 to 20 cm (4.7 to 7.9 inches), and their tail can measure around 15 to 25 cm (5.9 to 9.8 inches). They generally weigh between 80 to 160 grams (2.8 to 5.6 ounces).These treeshrews have a compact build with a long tail and relatively short limbs. They have a brownish-gray fur coat and a relatively small head with large eyes.Northern Treeshrews are primarily diurnal, meaning they are active during the day. They have a varied diet that includes fruits, insects, small vertebrates, and nectar. They are known for their agility in tree-climbing.The Northern Treeshrew is found in several countries in Southeast Asia, including India, Thailand, Malaysia, and parts of China. They inhabit a range of forested habitats, including tropical and subtropical forests.These treeshrews are well adapted to life in trees and are often found in various types of forests, from lowland rainforests to montane forests.Northern Treeshrews are known for their solitary behavior and territorial nature. They have specialized adaptations in their digestive system that allow them to efficiently process the nectar from flowers. They communicate using vocalizations and scent marking.{'English': ['Northern Treeshrew'], 'Other': ['Northern Tree shrew']}Least Concern\n","\n","Label: Uncia uncia\n","The Snow Leopard (Uncia uncia) is a large cat species found in the mountainous regions of Central and South Asia, including India. Recognizable by their stunning coat and elusive behavior, snow leopards are iconic animals of the high-altitude ecosystems they inhabit.Snow Leopards vary in size depending on their location and sex. On average, they have a body length ranging from about 75 to 130 cm (29.5 to 51.2 inches), and their tail can measure around 80 to 100 cm (31.5 to 39.4 inches). They generally weigh between 25 to 55 kg (55 to 121 lbs).Ground-colour pale yellowish-gray ; head, cheeks, and back of neck covered with small irregular dark spots, gradually changing posteriorly on the back and sides inte dark rings, running in lines on the back, but irregularly distributed on the shoulders, sides, and haunch; from the middle of the back to near the root of the tail on the median line is an irregular dark band, closely bordered on each side by a chain of oblong rings almost confluent ; limbs with small dark spots ; lower parts pale dingy yellowish-white, with some large dark spots about the middle of the abdomen, the rest unspotted ; ears externally black at the base, the tip yellow with a black edge ; tail very long, thick, and bushy, with incomplete broad bands, or with a double row of large black patches, unspotted below. The fur throughout is very dense, and it has a well-marked though short mane.It is stated to frequent rocky ground, and to kill the barrhel, wild sheep and also thar, domestic sheep, goats and dogs . Its color is adapted to that of its environment and the high position of its orbits allow it to peer over the edge of a rock to recconoitre for prey and detect it with least possible exposure of the head before creeping forth to stalk it. It lives on Ibex, Bharal and other wild goats and sheep other than musk deers, hares, marmots, picas probably and game birds as the Monal pheasant. It also takes, goat sheep and occasionally ponies from the herdsmen. It lies up most of the day and starts to hunt at about sundown, its generally nocturanal habits combined with the inaccessibility of its home, being the reason why it is so seldom seen.\n","\n","The snow leopard's vocalizations include meowing, grunting, prusten and moaning. They can purr when exhaling.\n","\n","It is solitary and mostly active at dawn till early morning, and again in afternoons and early evenings. They mostly rest near cliffs and ridges that provide vantage points and shade. In Nepal's Shey Phoksundo National Park , the home ranges of five adult radio-collared snow leopards largely overlapped, though they rarely met. Their individual home ranges ranged from 12 to 39 km 2 (4.6 to 15.1 sq mi). Males moved between 0.5 and 5.45 km (0.31 and 3.39 mi) per day, and females between 0.2 and 2.25 km (0.12 and 1.40 mi), measured in straight lines between survey points. Since they often zigzagged in the precipitous terrain, they actually moved up to 7 km (4.3 mi) in a single night. [39] Up to 10 individuals inhabit an area of ​​100 km 2 (40 sq mi); in habitats with sparse prey, an area of ​​1,000 km 2 (400 sq mi) usually supports only five individuals.\n","\n","A study in the Gobi Desert from 2008 to 2014 revealed that adult males used a mean home range of 144–270 km 2 (56–104 sq mi), while adult females ranged in areas of 83–165 km 2 (32–64 sq mid). Their home ranges overlapped less than 20%. These results indicate that about 40% of the 170 protected areas in their range countries are smaller than the home range of a single male snow leopard.\n","\n","Snow leopards leave scent marks to indicate their territories and common travel routes. They scrape the ground with the hind feet before depositing urine or feces , but also spray urine onto rocks. Their urine contains many characteristic low molecular weight compounds with various functional groups including pentanol , hexanol , heptanol , 3-octanone , nonanal and indole , which possibly play a role in chemical communication.Snow Leopards are found in several countries in Central and South Asia, including India, Nepal, Bhutan, and parts of China. They inhabit high-altitude mountainous regions.These leopards are highly adapted to cold and rugged mountain environments.

The coat varies greatly in length, thickness, and texture, according to the season, in some races ; the ground colour above is also exceedingly variable, from greyish or whitish-buff, with sometimes hardly a trace of buff, to olivaceous with a huffish tinge, or to bright reddish-oehreous ; below, from the front of the upper lip and chin backwards, including the lower cheek, the lower side of the tail and the inner surfaces of the limbs, it is generally wholly white, and sharply contrasted with the tint of the upper side and outside of the limbs, though the paws may be paler than the rest of the limbs ; there is a white patch on the otherwise black back of the ear, but there is no white patch over the eye as in the tiger. The pattern is very different from that of the tiger, but not unlike the pattern of some lion-cubs. Itconsists of solid black spots on the head, sometimes for a short distance behind it, on the outer side of the limbs and on the belly, which is typically heavily spotted, but elsewhere on the body the pattern mostly consists of definite \" rosettes \" which appear to result from the coalescence of some four or five smallish solid spots to form definite but irregularly shaped rings surrounding an area of darker tint as a rule, especially low down on the sides, than the brighter tint of the interspaces between the spots. The rosettes vary considerably in size and spacing, and on the spine, especially over the hind back and loins, they are usually more elongated and show a tendency to run in longitudinal stripe-like lines. On the tail the pattern is less regular and less rosette-like, the individual rosettes being liable to coalesce more or less towards the end above, whereas the underside here may be almost wholly unspotted, so that. when upturned it looks white. The normal pattern of leopards, above described, with its suggestion here and there of longitudinally lineal arrangement, is much more primitive than the highly specialized transverse stripes of the tiger. On account of its extensive distribution and capacity for adaptation to widely different environments the leopard varies locally in coloration much more than the lion or tiger, and many geographical races or subspecies of it have been described. Those admitted in the Indian fauna are considered below. But the species is also susceptible to an unusual amount of individual variation in colour and pattern in the same locality. These variations are termed \" varieties \" or \" spots.\" The \" black \" variety is the commonest of them. In this type the blackness is due to the deposit of black or dark brown pigment in the hairs that are normally yellow or white, so that the spots are obscured although probably always visible in certain lights and generally at least better defined on the underside because the normally white hair is browner than the normally yellow hair of the upper side. Leopards sometimes also exhibit the opposite phenomenon, namely, failure to develop pigment in the normally pigmented areas. This may result in complete albinism, when the pattern as well as the interspaces are white.It does not confine itself to the forests, but prowls among villages, carrying off sheep, goats, dogs, and sometimes commits great depredations. It is very fearless, frequently seizing a dog in the middle of a village, whilst the inhabitants are still stirring. It always seizes its prey by the back of the neck or the throat. It is a particularly silent creature, very stealthy, and will contrive to dodge and hide itself in places where it would appear impossible that a creature of its size could find concealment. They are popularly said to be much in the habit of climbing trees. They are fearful of water, and will not readily swim, and are therefore rarely found on small islands.

Known for their significance in culture and ecology, Asian elephants are an important and cherished species.Asian elephants vary in size, with males being larger than females. On average, males can have a shoulder height of around 2.7 to 3.2 meters (8.9 to 10.5 feet) and a body length of about 5.5 to 6.4 meters (18 to 21 feet), excluding the trunk and tail. Females are generally smaller.Skin nearly naked. Tail with a row of long coarse hairs for a few inches before and behind and round the end only. Five hoofs normally on each fore foot, four hoofs on each hind foot. The number of ridges in each molar from the first to the last is 4, 8, 12, 12, 16, and 24, with slight variation. Males as a rule have well developed tusks ; some males, known in India as makna, have merely short tusks like females. Colour blackish grey throughout. The forehead, base of the trunk, and the ears often mottled with flesh-colour. White elephants are albinoes. Head oblong, with a concave forehead ; crowns of the molars presenting narrow transverse ridges ; 4 toes to the hind-feet ; ears moderate; tusks large in the male, small in the female. Compared with the African elephant this species has much smaller ears. In the former the head is more rounded ; the grinders present broad lozenge-shaped eminences on their crowns ; and they have usually only 3 toes on their hindfeet. The number of pairs of ribs is, 19 in the Indian elephant, and 21 in the African, and there are 33 caudal vertebrre in tlie Indian, and never more than 26 in the African. In some males only one tusk is developed ; and in Ceylon many male elephants have the tusks very small.The country chiefly inhabited by elephants is tree-forest, undulating or hilly, generally containing bamboos in considerable quantities, but the animals often enter the high grass growing on alluvial flats. Individuals of various sizes and ages, and of both sexes, associate in herds, usually numbering 30 to 50, but not uncommonly more, sometimes 100. These herds often break up temporarily into smaller groups. The males are frequently found alone, but as a rule each belongs to a herd and joins it occasionally. All members of a herd generally belong to the same family, and are nearly related : different herds do not mix, but stray females or young males appear to obtain admission to a herd without difficulty. The leader of a herd is invariably a female. According to Sanderson a really solitary elephant is rare, many \" rogue \" elephants that have become notorious belonging to a herd. As a general rule, wild elephants are most timorous, and shun the presence of man as carefully as deer do. Now and then considerable damage is done by wild elephants to various crops, and a single male individual at times becomes savage, and kills any one that comes in his way. The food of elephants consists principally of various kinds of grass, leaves and shoots of bamboos, wild plantains (Musa), of which both stems and leaves are eaten, and leaves, small branches, and bark of particular trees, especially of species of Ficus. A full-grown elephant consumes between 600 and 700 lb. of green fodder per diem. Elephants drink twice a day in general, before sunset and after sunrise. Both food and drink are conveyed to the mouth by the trunk ; tufts of grass or branches of trees are plucked by coiling the end of the trunk round them ; leaves are stripped from boughs, and even bark from trees or branches, in a similar manner; only very small objects, such as small fruits, are picked up between the lobes above and below the nostrils at the tip of the trunk. In drinking, the end of the trunk is immersed and the lower part (in Sanderson's opinion not more than 15 or 18 inches) filled by suction with water, which is then discharged into the mouth. Grain such as rice is eaten in a similar way, being drawn into the end of the trunk and then blown into the mouth. In the wild state elephants roam about and feed for the greater part of the day and night, resting from about 9 or 10 a.m. till about 3 P.M. and again from about 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. They lie down to sleep like other mammals. Whilst feeding the herds scatter somewhat, but they quickly collect when alarmed. In many places elephants migrate considerable distances at particular seasons, chiefly in search of fodder, but partly it is believed to avoid insects, and generally from higher to lower ground or vice versd, or from one kind of forest to another. In marching, they keep in strict Indian file. They are fond of bathing and of rolling in mud in warm weather. They squirt water on their bodies with their trunks when heated, and when water is not at hand they draw some, by means not clearly understood, from the mouth or throat. The fluid thus obtained is probably a secretion, perhaps salivary. They sometimes, especially when exposed to the sun, throw dust or leaves over their backs. The sense of smell is highly developed, but neither sight nor hearing is particularly acute. The only pace of elephants is a walk, slow or quick, at times increased to a shuffling run. They are incapable of any motion resembling a gallop, or of the least jump, vertical or horizontal. A 7-foot trench is impassable by them, though a large elephant can clear 6.5 feet in its stride. They climb very steep places, bending the fore legs when ascending and the hind legs when descending, and kicking or pressing holes for the feet if necessary. In kneeling down an elephant first bends the hind legs one after the other, then the fore legs, which are stretched out in front ; in rising the process is reversed. Few animals not aquatic by nature swim as well as elephants. They have been known to swim for six hours or even more without resting. The pace is not rapid, probably about a mile an hour. Tlie principal sounds made by elephants are the following. First the shrill trumpet, varying in tone, and expressive, sometimes of fear, sometimes of auger. Secondly a roar from the throat, caused by fear or pain. A peculiar hoarse rumbling in the throat may express anger or want, as when a calf is calling for its mother. Pleasure is indicated by a continued low squeaking through the trunk. Lastly, there is a peculiar metallic sound made by rapping the end of the trunk on the ground and blowing through it at the same time. This indicates alarm or dislike, and is the well known indication of a tiger's presence. An elephant sometimes tries to frighten its enemies by blowing through its trunk. Most elephants are timid inoffensive animals, though individuals are vicious ; females with young offspring and solitary males or \" rogues \" being most disposed to attack. The attack is made with the trunk tightly coiled, the feet, and in males the tusks, being used for purposes of offence, and the adversary, if caught, is generally trampled upon. The young are generally born in September, October, and November, though a few are produced at other seasons. Twins are a rare exception, a single young one the rule. The young when born is about 3 feet high and weighs about 200 lb. It sucks with the mouth, not with the trunk, which is short and but little flexible. An elephant is full grown, but not fully mature, at 25 years of age, and individuals have been known to live over 100 years in captivity ; in a wild state their existence probably extends to 150 years. Male elephants are liable to periodical attacks of excitement, supposed to be of a sexual nature, though this does not appear clearly proved. During such attacks the animals are said to be \" mast,\" and are often dangerous to men or to other elephants. The attack is preceded and accompanied by the flow of an oily secretion from a small orifice in each temple.Asian elephants have a wide distribution across several Asian countries, including India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Thailand, and others. They inhabit a range of ecosystems, from forests to grasslands.Asian elephants are well adapted to forested environments where they can find food, water, and cover. They are known to migrate between different habitat types based on seasonal changes.The Asian Elephant is a megaherbivore, and is the only living species of the genus Elephas. It is smaller than the African Elephant and they are crepuscular in nature. Adult females and calfs move about in herds. Conflict between humans and elephants, due to their shrinking habitat, is one of the major conservation challenges of Asia.{'Assamese': ['A one-tusked male)', 'Gonesh (Especially', 'Haathi', 'Hati/ Hathi/ Mokhna', 'Mokhna (A tuskless male)'], 'Bengali': ['Haathi'], 'English': ['Asian Elephant', 'Indian Elephant'], 'Gonds': ['Yenu.'], 'Hindi': ['Haathi', 'Hathi'], 'Kannada': ['Aane', 'Anai'], 'Malayalam': ['Aana'], 'Malyalam': ['Anai'], 'Other': ['Anai', 'Asiatic Elephant', 'Yenu.'], 'Others (Tribal) Adi': ['Sot'], 'Others (Tribal) Apatani': ['Sete'], 'Others (Tribal) Bugun': ['Nathong'], 'Others (Tribal) Idu Mishmi': ['Aata'], 'Others (Tribal) Miji': ['Haati'], 'Others (Tribal) Sherdukpen': ['Stong'], 'Others (Tribal) Wancho': ['LÃ»ak'], 'Tamil': ['Anai', 'Yannai'], 'Telugu': ['Anai', 'Yenugu']}Endangered\n","\n","Label: Felis catus\n","The Domestic Cat (Felis catus) is a small carnivorous mammal that has been domesticated and kept as a companion animal for thousands of years.

Recognizable by their striking appearance and unique spiral-horned males, Blackbucks are known for their agility and distinctive behavior.Blackbucks vary in size depending on their sex, with males being larger than females. On average, males have a body length ranging from about 100 to 140 cm (39.4 to 55.1 inches), and their shoulder height can measure around 74 to 84 cm (29.1 to 33.1 inches). Females are generally smaller.The horns vary in divergence and in closeness of spiral ; in some the points are not more than 7 inches apart, in others as much as 20, irrespective of length ; the turns of the spiral in adults vary from less than 3 to 5. Horned females are occasionally, but very rarely, met with. Colour of does and young bucks yellowish-fawn above and on the outside of the limbs, lower parts white, the two colours sharply divided ; a distinct pale lateral band a little above the line of division. Old bucks are blackish brown above, becoming almost black in very old animals, except on the nape, which remains brownish rufous, whilst the sides and front of the neck, and also the face except a white area round each eye, are blackish brown. The pale lateral band disappears in old males.Open plains of short grass, level or undulating, and cultivated laiid are the usual haunts of the Indian antelope, which is generally found in herds ; these are sometimes extremely numerous, and comprise occasionally several thousand animals of both sexes and all ages ; but more often small herds of does, generally 10 to 30 in number, but sometimes as many as 50, are met with, attended by a single black buck, which does not always accompany the females. Very often two or three younger bucks coloured like the does remain with the latter ; but these young males are sometimes driven away by older bucks, and form separate herds. This antelope never enters forest nor high grass, and is but rarely seen amongst bushes. The Indian antelope appears to have no particular hours for feeding, though it generally rests in the middle of the day. The Indian antelope, has the habit of occasionally springing into the air, all the members of a herd generally bounding, one after the other. This is done, before they are much frightened, and when the herd is first moving off. When at speed the gallop is like that of any other animal. Occasionally these antelopes conceal themselves in grass or culti-vation, and wounded animals not unfrequently hide. Young fawns, too, are generally concealed by the mothers. The only sound the buck utter is a peculiar grunt that he makes when excited ; the females have a hissing alarm note, according to Forsyth. Like most other Indian antelopes, they deposit their dung repeatedly on the same spot. The rutting-season, says Mr. Elliot, commences about February or March, but fawns are seen of all ages at every season. During the spring months the buck often separates a particular doe from the herd, and will not suffer her to join it again, cutting her off and intercepting every attempt to mingle with the rest. The two are often found alone also, but on being followed always rejoin the herd.The Blackbuck is found in various parts of the Indian subcontinent, including India, Nepal, and Pakistan. They inhabit a range of grassland habitats.These antelopes are well adapted to grassland environments and are often found in open plains, savannas, and agricultural areas.Blackbucks are known for their social behavior, often forming herds consisting of females, young, and a dominant male.

Young spotted.The rib-faced deer is a solitary animal, usually found singly or in pairs. It keeps in thick jungle, only leaving the forest to graze on the skirts of the woods or in abandoned clearings. It has a wonderful way of getting through the thickest underwood, and it runs in a peculiar manner with its head low and its hind quarters high ; when not alarmed, as Colonel Hamilton observes, it steps \" daintily and warily, lifting each leg well above the grass or leaves.\" The call of this species, from which the common name of \"barking deer\" is derived, is at a little distance very like a single bark from a dog, and is very loud for the size of the animal. It is often repeated at intervals, usually in the morning and evening, sometimes after dark, and in the cold weather, which is the rutting-season. It is uttered by the animal when alarmed, as well as when calling its mate. Elliot and Jerdon state that the tongue is very long and extensile, and this deer often licks the whole face with it. McMaster and Sterndale confirm this. When the buck is attacked by dogs it uses its canine teeth in defence and inflicts severe wounds with them. Colonel Hamilton has pointed out that these teeth are not fixed firmly in the jaw, but that the animal has some power of moving them. Several observers have noticed a peculiar rattling noice, like that produced by a pair of castanets, made by this deer when running, but the cause is not known.

Tigers are generally solitary and hunt individually. They establish and maintain home ranges. Tigers are carnivores and prefer large ungulates as prey. However they are known to even take other predators. Over the past century tiger numbers have fallen dramatically, with a decreasing population trend and there is continued human-tiger conflict.Adult males measure 5.5 to 6.5 feet from nose to insertion of tail, the tail being about 3 feet long. Females measure about 5 to 5.5 feet from nose to rump. The height at the shoulder is about 3 feet to 3 feet 6 inches.The tiger is the largest of the \"Big cats\" with a reddish-orange to yellow-ochre coat, a white belly and black stripes. The stripes vary in their width, spacing and length and may be single or double.No two individuals exhibit the same stripe pattern. The chest, throat, muzzle and insides of its limbs are white or creamy and a white area above its eye, extending onto the cheeks. A white spot occurs behing the ear and the tail is ringed with dark bands. Colour variation is seen in the wild such as whitish tigers with chocolate stripes being seen. Young animals, are more brightly coloured than old. The young are born striped. Both black and albino tigers have been\" met with, though both are very rare.These animals are usually found solitary or in pairs, less frequently in parties of from three to six. They remain at rest during the day, and roam about at night in search of food. Their wanderings are considerable, and frequently extend to many miles in the course of the night, a preference being given to well-beaten tracks or sandy beds of streams. It is a solitary and territorial creature, with males occupying a larger territory which overlaps that of several females with whom he will mate. The tiger sometimes continues his stroll in the early morning, and his movements, as Forsyth remarks, \"may often be traced up to eight or nine o'clock by the voices of monkeys and peafowl, the chatter of crows and small birds, and the bark of sambar and spotted deer.\" The tiger usually takes up his abode for the day in deep shade, especially in the hot season, and in general near water under a dense bush or tree, in high green grass, or in thick low cover such as green rushes, tamarisk, or some of the other plants that grow in the beds of streams. The tigress is said to avoid the male when about to bring forth, and to hide her young from him ; but tigers are occasionally, though not often, seen accompanying tigresses and cubs. The young remain with the mother until nearly or quite full-grown ; and when more than two tigers are found consorting together, the party consists in general of a tigress and her full-grown offspring, the old tiger occasionally associating with his family also. The territory is marked with urine sprays and scrapes, onto trees, bushes and rock faces. Feaces and scrapes may also be left along trails. Mating occurs throughout the year. The gestation period is for four months and a normal litter size is two to three cubs. It is an ambush predator and usually hunts by night, with the chief prey consisting of deers and wild pigs. Their usual call is very similar to that of the lion, a prolonged moaning, thrilling sound, repeated twice or thrice, becoming louder and quicker, and ending with three or four repetitions of the last portion of it. Besides this, there is a peculiar loud \"woof\" produced when the animal is disturbed or surprised, a growl that it utters when provoked, and the well-known guttural sound of rage repeated two or three times when it charges. Tigers swim well and take readily to water, but rarely ascend trees, and appear quite incapable of climbing a vertical stem, large or small. hey have a habit, like cats, of scratching wood, and often show a predilection for the trunk of a particular tree, on which the marks of their claws may be seen up to a height of 10 or, it is said, 12 feet. The wild animals commonly eaten by tigers are pigs, deer of all kinds, nylgai, four-horned antelope, and porcupines. Peafowl may be slain at times and the same may be said of monkeys. Bears, though not often attacked, occasionally fall victims. Young gaur are occasionally killed, but the full-grown animal is more than a match for most tigers. Instances are said to have been known of even young elepliants being attacked, one such is mentioned by McMaster. In fact a hungry tiger will probably kill any other animal he can for food. He is said to have been observed catching and eating frogs ; and Mr. Simson found tigers in Eastern Bengal, during inundations, feeding upon fish, tortoises, crocodiles, and large lizards, and he once killed a tiger the pouch of which was crammed with grasshoppers or locusts. If an animal is struck down in the daytime, the body may be dragged some distance, but is usually left untouched till evening. At or soon after nightfall, or occasionally in quiet places before sundown, the tiger returns to the kill and, if the spot is open or otherwise unsuited for his repast, drags the body to a more convenient place. He almost always commences by eating the intestines and hindquarters. As a rule he remains near the kill, sometimes rushing out upon any intruder and driving away jackals, vultures, and other carrion-feeders ; but more often he hides the carcase under bushes or leaves, and retires to a neigh-bouring thicket beside water. If very hungry, a tiger will devour both hindquarters the first night. If undisturbed, he generally remains about three days near the carcase, feeding at intervals. Although tigers as a rule kill their own food, they do not disdain carrionThe Bengal Tiger's range historically included a significant portion of the Indian subcontinent, including India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and Myanmar. However, habitat loss and poaching have significantly reduced their distribution.Tigers inhabit diverse habitats such as tropical rainforests, grasslands, mangrove swamps, and deciduous forests. They are highly adaptable but require areas with sufficient prey and suitable cover for hunting.Bengal Tigers are apex predators and play a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of their habitats. They mark their territories using scent markings and vocalizations, including roars and calls. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect these tigers and their habitats, as they are currently endangered due to threats like habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict.{'Baluchi': ['Babr', 'Mazar'], 'Bengali': ['Go-ragh'], 'Coorg': ['Nari'], 'English': ['Bengal Tiger', 'Tiger'], 'Hindi': ['Bagh', 'Bagni', 'Nahar', 'Sela-ragh of Central India', 'Sela-ragh.

Recognizable by its gray fur and distinct facial features, the Kashmir Gray Langur is known for its adaptation to mountainous and forested habitats.Kashmir gray langurs are big monkeys, larger than other langur species. Males and females are both formidable in size, with a head-to-body length measurement of 26.4 in (67.1 cm) and an average weight of 39 lb (17.7 kg). A long tail that arcs over the back adds to their overall length.\n","\n","Lifespan for this little-studied species has not been documented. Its cousin, the northern plains gray langur (whom scientists had once believed was a parent species to the Kashmir gray langur) is reported to live up to 30 years in captivity. In the wild, males don’t typically live past 18 year of age, while females live into their 30s.These are striking primates, distinguished from other gray langur species by their immense size and darker-colored fore and hind limbs. The silvery-gray fur coat that cloaks their back and limbs is long and silky. In contrast, the chest and abdomen are dressed in white fur, with a hint of pale yellow. Dark eyes peer out from a hairless black face that is framed by a generous, “poofy,” silky white muffler that tries to conceal the monkey’s dark, hairless ears. Fingers are fitted with long, dark nails. The Kashmir gray langur’s long, nonprehensile tail, which it carries arched over its back and curved toward the head while walking on the ground, appears to have had the tip dipped in white paint, like an artist’s brush.These are primates who are both terrestrial (spending time on the ground) and arboreal (spending time in the trees). Gray langurs move quadrupedally (on all four limbs) and are inclined to run, rather than walk, whether on the ground or moving through trees. On the ground, they sometimes alternate running with walking a few steps between their gait. In the trees, they assume an upright stance and leap horizontally 12–15 ft (3.7–4.6 m) as they travel from branch to branch. Descending leaps can be as much as 35–40 ft (10.7–12.2 m). Gray langurs are also known to hop bipedally (standing upright, hopping on the two rear limbs). And they are capable of swimming, if they must. One wildlife study reports that after several langurs accidentally fell into water, they swam to the safety of solid ground.\n","\n","Kashmir gray langurs are diurnal, meaning they are active during daylight hours. Activity budget for a typical day is spent accordingly: feeding (39.8 percent), resting (29.2 percent), traveling (17.5 percent), grooming (9.5 percent), and huddling (3.2 percent), with other activities filling any gap. Wildlife researchers have observed significant differences in the amount of time spent by male, female, and juvenile langurs in social activities and feeding. Males appear to spend more time feeding and foraging than females, and juveniles spend the most time in social activity such as play. Playing is more than a casual, fun pastime: it serves to develop physical and behavioral development, along with helping to develop social bonds. Wildlife researchers observed no significant time differences spent resting and traveling among troop members.The Chamba Valley of Himachal Pradesh, a mountainous state of northwestern India situated in the Western Himalayas, is home to the Kashmir gray langur (Semnopithecus ajax). Whether or not this leaf-eating monkey inhabits the region of Kashmir (one of the species’s namesakes) is uncertain. However, some wildlife biologists assert that Kashmir and the territory of Jammu (each claimed by both India and Pakistan) are included in this species’s restricted geographic distribution. Still other biologists include Melamchi, Nepal, in this primate’s range.They inhabit a range of habitats in the Himalayas, including montane forests, mountainous areas, and valleys.Surrounded by Chamba’s high peaks, Kashmir gray langurs inhabit a variety of habitats including subtropical, tropical, moist temperate, alpine cedar, coniferous and broadleaved forests, and subalpine scrublands, dwelling between 7,218 and 13,123 ft (2,200–4,000 m) above sea level. They live in fragmented populations with an extent of occurrence of less than 1,930 sq mi (5,000 sq km), occupying less than 193 sq mi (500 sq km) of the valleys in their rugged Himalayan mountain ecosystem.

Though each animal is solitary as a rule, several are often found in the same patch of jungle. Despite its bulk and strength, this rhinoceros is as a rule a quiet inoffensive animal. A rhinoceros when wounded or driven about will, however, sometimes charge home, though this is an exception. When it does attack, this species uses its sharp lower incisors (or, as some think, lower canines) much as a hog does. The only sound known to be produced by the present animal is a peculiar grunt that it repeats frequently when excited. It is said by several writers to have a habit of depositing its dung in the same spot until a pile accumulates. Like other Ungulata, rhinoceroses can trot and gallop as well as walk.

The rosettes vary considerably in size and spacing, and on the spine, especially over the hind back and loins, they are usually more elongated and show a tendency to run in longitudinal stripe-like lines. On the tail the pattern is less regular and less rosette-like, the individual rosettes being liable to coalesce more or less towards the end above, whereas the underside here may be almost wholly unspotted, so that. when upturned it looks white. The normal pattern of leopards, above described, with its suggestion here and there of longitudinally lineal arrangement, is much more primitive than the highly specialized transverse stripes of the tiger. On account of its extensive distribution and capacity for adaptation to widely different environments the leopard varies locally in coloration much more than the lion or tiger, and many geographical races or subspecies of it have been described. Those admitted in the Indian fauna are considered below. But the species is also susceptible to an unusual amount of individual variation in colour and pattern in the same locality. These variations are termed \" varieties \" or \" spots.\" The \" black \" variety is the commonest of them. In this type the blackness is due to the deposit of black or dark brown pigment in the hairs that are normally yellow or white, so that the spots are obscured although probably always visible in certain lights and generally at least better defined on the underside because the normally white hair is browner than the normally yellow hair of the upper side. Leopards sometimes also exhibit the opposite phenomenon, namely, failure to develop pigment in the normally pigmented areas. This may result in complete albinism, when the pattern as well as the interspaces are white.\n","[SEP]\n","[CLS] Behavior\n","It does not confine itself to the forests, but prowls among villages, carrying off sheep, goats, dogs, and sometimes commits great depredations. It is very fearless, frequently seizing a dog in the middle of a village, whilst the inhabitants are still stirring. It always seizes its prey by the back of the neck or the throat. It is a particularly silent creature, very stealthy, and will contrive to dodge and hide itself in places where it would appear impossible that a creature of its size could find concealment. They are popularly said to be much in the habit of climbing trees. They are fearful of water, and will not readily swim, and are therefore rarely found on small islands. Like the Tiger, the Leopard will, if hungry, eat any dead carcass he can find. Leopards occasionally take to man-eating and, owing to their boldness, become even a more fearful scourge than tigers.\n","\n","Leopards are solitary and secretive animals, and their behavior can vary based on their habitat and prey availability.

In some males only one tusk is developed ; and in Ceylon many male elephants have the tusks very small.\n","[SEP]\n","[CLS] Behavior\n","The country chiefly inhabited by elephants is tree-forest, undulating or hilly, generally containing bamboos in considerable quantities, but the animals often enter the high grass growing on alluvial flats. Individuals of various sizes and ages, and of both sexes, associate in herds, usually numbering 30 to 50, but not uncommonly more, sometimes 100. These herds often break up temporarily into smaller groups. The males are frequently found alone, but as a rule each belongs to a herd and joins it occasionally. All members of a herd generally belong to the same family, and are nearly related : different herds do not mix, but stray females or young males appear to obtain admission to a herd without difficulty. The leader of a herd is invariably a female. According to Sanderson a really solitary elephant is rare, many \" rogue \" elephants that have become notorious belonging to a herd. As a general rule, wild elephants are most timorous, and shun the presence of man as carefully as deer do. Now and then considerable damage is done by wild elephants to various crops, and a single male individual at times becomes savage, and kills any one that comes in his way. The food of elephants consists principally of various kinds of grass, leaves and shoots of bamboos, wild plantains (Musa), of which both stems and leaves are eaten, and leaves, small branches, and bark of particular trees, especially of species of Ficus. A full-grown elephant consumes between 600 and 700 lb. of green fodder per diem. Elephants drink twice a day in general, before sunset and after sunrise. Both food and drink are conveyed to the mouth by the trunk ; tufts of grass or branches of trees are plucked by coiling the end of the trunk round them ; leaves are stripped from boughs, and even bark from trees or branches, in a similar manner; only very small objects, such as small fruits, are picked up between the lobes above and below the nostrils at the tip of the trunk. In drinking, the end of the trunk is immersed and the lower part (in Sanderson's opinion not more than 15 or 18 inches) filled by suction with water, which is then discharged into the mouth. Grain such as rice is eaten in a similar way, being drawn into the end of the trunk and then blown into the mouth. In the wild state elephants roam about and feed for the greater part of the day and night, resting from about 9 or 10 a.m. till about 3 P.M. and again from about 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. They lie down to sleep like other mammals. Whilst feeding the herds scatter somewhat, but they quickly collect when alarmed. In many places elephants migrate considerable distances at particular seasons, chiefly in search of fodder, but partly it is believed to avoid insects, and generally from higher to lower ground or vice versd, or from one kind of forest to another. In marching, they keep in strict Indian file. They are fond of bathing and of rolling in mud in warm weather. They squirt water on their bodies with their trunks when heated, and when water is not at hand they draw some, by means not clearly understood, from the mouth or throat. The fluid thus obtained is probably a secretion, perhaps salivary. They sometimes, especially when exposed to the sun, throw dust or leaves over their backs. The sense of smell is highly developed, but neither sight nor hearing is particularly acute. The only pace of elephants is a walk, slow or quick, at times increased to a shuffling run. They are incapable of any motion resembling a gallop, or of the least jump, vertical or horizontal. A 7-foot trench is impassable by them, though a large elephant can clear 6.5 feet in its stride. They climb very steep places, bending the fore legs when ascending and the hind legs when descending, and kicking or pressing holes for the feet if necessary. In kneeling down an elephant first bends the hind legs one after the other, then the fore legs, which are stretched out in front ; in rising the process is reversed. Few animals not aquatic by nature swim as well as elephants. They have been known to swim for six hours or even more without resting. The pace is not rapid, probably about a mile an hour. Tlie principal sounds made by elephants are the following. First the shrill trumpet, varying in tone, and expressive, sometimes of fear, sometimes of auger. Secondly a roar from the throat, caused by fear or pain. A peculiar hoarse rumbling in the throat may express anger or want, as when a calf is calling for its mother. Pleasure is indicated by a continued low squeaking through the trunk. Lastly, there is a peculiar metallic sound made by rapping the end of the trunk on the ground and blowing through it at the same time. This indicates alarm or dislike, and is the well known indication of a tiger's presence. An elephant sometimes tries to frighten its enemies by blowing through its trunk. Most elephants are timid inoffensive animals, though individuals are vicious ; females with young offspring and solitary males or \" rogues \" being most disposed to attack. The attack is made with the trunk tightly coiled, the feet, and in males the tusks, being used for purposes of offence, and the adversary, if caught, is generally trampled upon. The young are generally born in September, October, and November, though a few are produced at other seasons. Twins are a rare exception, a single young one the rule. The young when born is about 3 feet high and weighs about 200 lb. It sucks with the mouth, not with the trunk, which is short and but little flexible. An elephant is full grown, but not fully mature, at 25 years of age, and individuals have been known to live over 100 years in captivity ; in a wild state their existence probably extends to 150 years. Male elephants are liable to periodical attacks of excitement, supposed to be of a sexual nature, though this does not appear clearly proved. During such attacks the animals are said to be \" mast,\" and are often dangerous to men or to other elephants. The attack is preceded and accompanied by the flow of an oily secretion from a small orifice in each temple.\n","[SEP]\n","[CLS] Distribution\n","Asian elephants have a wide distribution across several Asian countries, including India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Thailand, and others.

The pale lateral band disappears in old males.\n","[SEP]\n","[CLS] Behavior\n","Open plains of short grass, level or undulating, and cultivated laiid are the usual haunts of the Indian antelope, which is generally found in herds ; these are sometimes extremely numerous, and comprise occasionally several thousand animals of both sexes and all ages ; but more often small herds of does, generally 10 to 30 in number, but sometimes as many as 50, are met with, attended by a single black buck, which does not always accompany the females. Very often two or three younger bucks coloured like the does remain with the latter ; but these young males are sometimes driven away by older bucks, and form separate herds. This antelope never enters forest nor high grass, and is but rarely seen amongst bushes. The Indian antelope appears to have no particular hours for feeding, though it generally rests in the middle of the day. The Indian antelope, has the habit of occasionally springing into the air, all the members of a herd generally bounding, one after the other. This is done, before they are much frightened, and when the herd is first moving off. When at speed the gallop is like that of any other animal. Occasionally these antelopes conceal themselves in grass or culti-vation, and wounded animals not unfrequently hide. Young fawns, too, are generally concealed by the mothers. The only sound the buck utter is a peculiar grunt that he makes when excited ; the females have a hissing alarm note, according to Forsyth. Like most other Indian antelopes, they deposit their dung repeatedly on the same spot. The rutting-season, says Mr. Elliot, commences about February or March, but fawns are seen of all ages at every season. During the spring months the buck often separates a particular doe from the herd, and will not suffer her to join it again, cutting her off and intercepting every attempt to mingle with the rest. The two are often found alone also, but on being followed always rejoin the herd.\n","[SEP]\n","[CLS] Distribution\n","The Blackbuck is found in various parts of the Indian subcontinent, including India, Nepal, and Pakistan.

It is often repeated at intervals, usually in the morning and evening, sometimes after dark, and in the cold weather, which is the rutting-season. It is uttered by the animal when alarmed, as well as when calling its mate. Elliot and Jerdon state that the tongue is very long and extensile, and this deer often licks the whole face with it. McMaster and Sterndale confirm this. When the buck is attacked by dogs it uses its canine teeth in defence and inflicts severe wounds with them. Colonel Hamilton has pointed out that these teeth are not fixed firmly in the jaw, but that the animal has some power of moving them.

Young animals, are more brightly coloured than old. The young are born striped. Both black and albino tigers have been\" met with, though both are very rare.\n","[SEP]\n","[CLS] Behavior\n","These animals are usually found solitary or in pairs, less frequently in parties of from three to six. They remain at rest during the day, and roam about at night in search of food. Their wanderings are considerable, and frequently extend to many miles in the course of the night, a preference being given to well-beaten tracks or sandy beds of streams. It is a solitary and territorial creature, with males occupying a larger territory which overlaps that of several females with whom he will mate. The tiger sometimes continues his stroll in the early morning, and his movements, as Forsyth remarks, \"may often be traced up to eight or nine o'clock by the voices of monkeys and peafowl, the chatter of crows and small birds, and the bark of sambar and spotted deer.\" The tiger usually takes up his abode for the day in deep shade, especially in the hot season, and in general near water under a dense bush or tree, in high green grass, or in thick low cover such as green rushes, tamarisk, or some of the other plants that grow in the beds of streams. The tigress is said to avoid the male when about to bring forth, and to hide her young from him ; but tigers are occasionally, though not often, seen accompanying tigresses and cubs. The young remain with the mother until nearly or quite full-grown ; and when more than two tigers are found consorting together, the party consists in general of a tigress and her full-grown offspring, the old tiger occasionally associating with his family also. The territory is marked with urine sprays and scrapes, onto trees, bushes and rock faces. Feaces and scrapes may also be left along trails. Mating occurs throughout the year. The gestation period is for four months and a normal litter size is two to three cubs. It is an ambush predator and usually hunts by night, with the chief prey consisting of deers and wild pigs. Their usual call is very similar to that of the lion, a prolonged moaning, thrilling sound, repeated twice or thrice, becoming louder and quicker, and ending with three or four repetitions of the last portion of it. Besides this, there is a peculiar loud \"woof\" produced when the animal is disturbed or surprised, a growl that it utters when provoked, and the well-known guttural sound of rage repeated two or three times when it charges. Tigers swim well and take readily to water, but rarely ascend trees, and appear quite incapable of climbing a vertical stem, large or small. hey have a habit, like cats, of scratching wood, and often show a predilection for the trunk of a particular tree, on which the marks of their claws may be seen up to a height of 10 or, it is said, 12 feet. The wild animals commonly eaten by tigers are pigs, deer of all kinds, nylgai, four-horned antelope, and porcupines. Peafowl may be slain at times and the same may be said of monkeys. Bears, though not often attacked, occasionally fall victims. Young gaur are occasionally killed, but the full-grown animal is more than a match for most tigers. Instances are said to have been known of even young elepliants being attacked, one such is mentioned by McMaster. In fact a hungry tiger will probably kill any other animal he can for food. He is said to have been observed catching and eating frogs ; and Mr. Simson found tigers in Eastern Bengal, during inundations, feeding upon fish, tortoises, crocodiles, and large lizards, and he once killed a tiger the pouch of which was crammed with grasshoppers or locusts. If an animal is struck down in the daytime, the body may be dragged some distance, but is usually left untouched till evening. At or soon after nightfall, or occasionally in quiet places before sundown, the tiger returns to the kill and, if the spot is open or otherwise unsuited for his repast, drags the body to a more convenient place. He almost always commences by eating the intestines and hindquarters. As a rule he remains near the kill, sometimes rushing out upon any intruder and driving away jackals, vultures, and other carrion-feeders ; but more often he hides the carcase under bushes or leaves, and retires to a neigh-bouring thicket beside water. If very hungry, a tiger will devour both hindquarters the first night. If undisturbed, he generally remains about three days near the carcase, feeding at intervals. Although tigers as a rule kill their own food, they do not disdain carrion\n","[SEP]\n","[CLS] Distribution\n","The Bengal Tiger's range historically included a significant portion of the Indian subcontinent, including India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and Myanmar.

Gray langurs move quadrupedally (on all four limbs) and are inclined to run, rather than walk, whether on the ground or moving through trees. On the ground, they sometimes alternate running with walking a few steps between their gait. In the trees, they assume an upright stance and leap horizontally 12–15 ft (3.7–4.6 m) as they travel from branch to branch. Descending leaps can be as much as 35–40 ft (10.7–12.2 m). Gray langurs are also known to hop bipedally (standing upright, hopping on the two rear limbs). And they are capable of swimming, if they must. One wildlife study reports that after several langurs accidentally fell into water, they swam to the safety of solid ground.\n","\n","Kashmir gray langurs are diurnal, meaning they are active during daylight hours. Activity budget for a typical day is spent accordingly: feeding (39.8 percent), resting (29.2 percent), traveling (17.5 percent), grooming (9.5 percent), and huddling (3.2 percent), with other activities filling any gap. Wildlife researchers have observed significant differences in the amount of time spent by male, female, and juvenile langurs in social activities and feeding. Males appear to spend more time feeding and foraging than females, and juveniles spend the most time in social activity such as play. Playing is more than a casual, fun pastime: it serves to develop physical and behavioral development, along with helping to develop social bonds.

Though each animal is solitary as a rule, several are often found in the same patch of jungle. Despite its bulk and strength, this rhinoceros is as a rule a quiet inoffensive animal. A rhinoceros when wounded or driven about will, however, sometimes charge home, though this is an exception. When it does attack, this species uses its sharp lower incisors (or, as some think, lower canines) much as a hog does. The only sound known to be produced by the present animal is a peculiar grunt that it repeats frequently when excited. It is said by several writers to have a habit of depositing its dung in the same spot until a pile accumulates. Like other Ungulata, rhinoceroses can trot and gallop as well as walk.
