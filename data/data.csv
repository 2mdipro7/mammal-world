Manis crassicaudata,"The Indian Pangolin (Manis crassicaudata) is a unique and distinctive mammal found in various parts of South Asia, including India. Recognizable by their armor-like scales and distinctive appearance, pangolins are fascinating creatures with specialized behaviors and ecological roles.","It is about 84–122 cm (33–48 in) long from head to tail, the tail usually being 33–47 cm (13–19 in) long, and weighs 10–16 kg (22–35 lb). Females are generally smaller than the males and have one pair of mammae. The pangolin possesses a cone-shaped head with small, dark eyes, and a long muzzle with a nose pad similar in color, or darker than, its pinkish-brown skin. It has powerful limbs, tipped with sharp, clawed digits. The pangolin has no teeth, but has strong stomach muscles to aid in digestion. The most noticeable characteristic of the pangolin is its massive, scaled armour, which covers its upper face and its whole body with the exception of the belly and the inside of the legs. These protective scales are rigid and made of keratin. It has 160–200 scales in total, about 40–46% of which are located on the tail. Scales are 6.5–7 cm (2.6–2.8 in) long, 8.5 cm (3.3 in) wide, and weigh 7–10 g (0.25–0.35 oz). The skin and scales make up about one-fourth to one-third of the total body mass of this species.","The most striking aspect of the Indian Pangolin's morphology are the scales that cover most of it's body except the face and ventral aspect. Dorsally it appears to be covered by a suit of about 11-18 rows of yellowish scales. It has a small head and the mouth is tubular in appearance. The eyes are small and the ears appear as slits in the skin, with very small pinnae. The nose has large nostrils with flaps that enable it to be closed. It's tongue is long and sticky. It's forelimbs are powerful thus enabling it to dig, and armed with three long claws. It's long tail ends in a scale. The Indian Pangolin has a distictive scaly appearance, tubular mouth and a long scaly tail.","Nocturnal, fossorial, terrestrial. The Indian pangolin is a solitary, shy, slow-moving, nocturnal mammal.
The Indian pangolin is nocturnal and mostly active intermittently between 17:00 and 05:00 hr. The peak period of activity was observed between 20:00–21:00 hr in captive individuals with some individual variation.[7]

The Indian pangolin does not climb trees, but it does value the presence of trees, herbs, and shrubs in its habitat because it is easier to dig burrows around them. Features that promote an abundance of ants and termites like grasses, bare grounds, bases of trees, shrubs, roots, leaf litter, fallen logs and elephant feces are often present in pangolin habitats.[5]

Pangolin burrows fall into one of two categories: feeding and living burrows. Feeding burrows are smaller than living burrows (though their sizes vary depending on the abundance of prey) and are created more frequently during the spring, when there is a greater availability of prey. Living burrows are wider, deeper, and more circular, and are occupied for a longer time than feeding burrows, as they are mainly used to sleep and rest during the day. After a few months, the pangolin abandons the burrow and digs a new one close to a food source. However, it is not uncommon for the pangolin to shift back to an old burrow.","The Indian pangolin has been recorded in various forest types, including Sri Lankan rainforest and plains to middle hill levels. It inhabits grasslands and secondary forests, and is well adapted to dry areas and desert regions, but prefers more barren, hilly regions. In Sri Lanka, it was sighted at an elevation of 1,100 m (3,600 ft), and in the Nilgiri mountains at 2,300 m (7,500 ft). It prefers soft and semi-sandy soil conditions suitable for digging burrows.","These pangolins are adaptable to various environments and can be found in diverse habitats, including tropical and subtropical forests, grasslands, and agricultural areas.","Indian Pangolins are known for their solitary behavior and elusive nature. They are expert diggers and use their strong claws to excavate ant and termite nests.

Uncia uncia,"The Snow Leopard (Uncia uncia) is a large cat species found in the mountainous regions of Central and South Asia, including India. Recognizable by their stunning coat and elusive behavior, snow leopards are iconic animals of the high-altitude ecosystems they inhabit.","Snow Leopards vary in size depending on their location and sex. On average, they have a body length ranging from about 75 to 130 cm (29.5 to 51.2 inches), and their tail can measure around 80 to 100 cm (31.5 to 39.4 inches). They generally weigh between 25 to 55 kg (55 to 121 lbs).","Ground-colour pale yellowish-gray ; head, cheeks, and back of neck covered with small irregular dark spots, gradually changing posteriorly on the back and sides inte dark rings, running in lines on the back, but irregularly distributed on the shoulders, sides, and haunch; from the middle of the back to near the root of the tail on the median line is an irregular dark band, closely bordered on each side by a chain of oblong rings almost confluent ; limbs with small dark spots ; lower parts pale dingy yellowish-white, with some large dark spots about the middle of the abdomen, the rest unspotted ; ears externally black at the base, the tip yellow with a black edge ; tail very long, thick, and bushy, with incomplete broad bands, or with a double row of large black patches, unspotted below. The fur throughout is very dense, and it has a well-marked though short mane.","It is stated to frequent rocky ground, and to kill the barrhel, wild sheep and also thar, domestic sheep, goats and dogs . Its color is adapted to that of its environment and the high position of its orbits allow it to peer over the edge of a rock to recconoitre for prey and detect it with least possible exposure of the head before creeping forth to stalk it. It lives on Ibex, Bharal and other wild goats and sheep other than musk deers, hares, marmots, picas probably and game birds as the Monal pheasant. It also takes, goat sheep and occasionally ponies from the herdsmen. It lies up most of the day and starts to hunt at about sundown, its generally nocturanal habits combined with the inaccessibility of its home, being the reason why it is so seldom seen.

The snow leopard's vocalizations include meowing, grunting, prusten and moaning. They can purr when exhaling.

It is solitary and mostly active at dawn till early morning, and again in afternoons and early evenings. They mostly rest near cliffs and ridges that provide vantage points and shade. In Nepal's Shey Phoksundo National Park , the home ranges of five adult radio-collared snow leopards largely overlapped, though they rarely met. Their individual home ranges ranged from 12 to 39 km 2 (4.6 to 15.1 sq mi). Males moved between 0.5 and 5.45 km (0.31 and 3.39 mi) per day, and females between 0.2 and 2.25 km (0.12 and 1.40 mi), measured in straight lines between survey points. Since they often zigzagged in the precipitous terrain, they actually moved up to 7 km (4.3 mi) in a single night. [39] Up to 10 individuals inhabit an area of ​​100 km 2 (40 sq mi); in habitats with sparse prey, an area of ​​1,000 km 2 (400 sq mi) usually supports only five individuals.

A study in the Gobi Desert from 2008 to 2014 revealed that adult males used a mean home range of 144–270 km 2 (56–104 sq mi), while adult females ranged in areas of 83–165 km 2 (32–64 sq mid). Their home ranges overlapped less than 20%. These results indicate that about 40% of the 170 protected areas in their range countries are smaller than the home range of a single male snow leopard.

Snow leopards leave scent marks to indicate their territories and common travel routes. They scrape the ground with the hind feet before depositing urine or feces , but also spray urine onto rocks. Their urine contains many characteristic low molecular weight compounds with various functional groups including pentanol , hexanol , heptanol , 3-octanone , nonanal and indole , which possibly play a role in chemical communication.","Snow Leopards are found in several countries in Central and South Asia, including India, Nepal, Bhutan, and parts of China.

Panthera pardus,"The Leopard (Panthera pardus) is a large and highly adaptable big cat species found across a wide range of habitats in Africa and Asia, including India. Known for its distinctive rosette-spotted coat, leopards are skilled predators and are capable of thriving in diverse environments.","Leopards are medium to large-sized cats, with body lengths typically ranging from 90 to 190 cm (35 to 75 inches), excluding the tail. The tail can add an additional 60 to 110 cm (24 to 43 inches) to the total length. Adult leopards usually weigh between 20 to 90 kg (44 to 198 lbs), with males being larger than females.","Size considerably less than that of the tiger or lion, the length of the head and body seldom exceeding 4 ft., with the tail considerably over half the length of the head and body, the hair on the cheeks never growing into a definite fringe longer than that of the body and, although the hair on the nape typically forms a median crest from the junction of convergent streams from the sides of the neck, as in lions, it never, even in the male. forms anything approaching a definite mane. The coat varies greatly in length, thickness, and texture, according to the season, in some races ; the ground colour above is also exceedingly variable, from greyish or whitish-buff, with sometimes hardly a trace of buff, to olivaceous with a huffish tinge, or to bright reddish-oehreous ; below, from the front of the upper lip and chin backwards, including the lower cheek, the lower side of the tail and the inner surfaces of the limbs, it is generally wholly white, and sharply contrasted with the tint of the upper side and outside of the limbs, though the paws may be paler than the rest of the limbs ; there is a white patch on the otherwise black back of the ear, but there is no white patch over the eye as in the tiger. The pattern is very different from that of the tiger, but not unlike the pattern of some lion-cubs. Itconsists of solid black spots on the head, sometimes for a short distance behind it, on the outer side of the limbs and on the belly, which is typically heavily spotted, but elsewhere on the body the pattern mostly consists of definite "" rosettes "" which appear to result from the coalescence of some four or five smallish solid spots to form definite but irregularly shaped rings surrounding an area of darker tint as a rule, especially low down on the sides, than the brighter tint of the interspaces between the spots. The rosettes vary considerably in size and spacing, and on the spine, especially over the hind back and loins, they are usually more elongated and show a tendency to run in longitudinal stripe-like lines. On the tail the pattern is less regular and less rosette-like, the individual rosettes being liable to coalesce more or less towards the end above, whereas the underside here may be almost wholly unspotted, so that. when upturned it looks white. The normal pattern of leopards, above described, with its suggestion here and there of longitudinally lineal arrangement, is much more primitive than the highly specialized transverse stripes of the tiger. On account of its extensive distribution and capacity for adaptation to widely different environments the leopard varies locally in coloration much more than the lion or tiger, and many geographical races or subspecies of it have been described. Those admitted in the Indian fauna are considered below. But the species is also susceptible to an unusual amount of individual variation in colour and pattern in the same locality. These variations are termed "" varieties "" or "" spots."" The "" black "" variety is the commonest of them. In this type the blackness is due to the deposit of black or dark brown pigment in the hairs that are normally yellow or white, so that the spots are obscured although probably always visible in certain lights and generally at least better defined on the underside because the normally white hair is browner than the normally yellow hair of the upper side. Leopards sometimes also exhibit the opposite phenomenon, namely, failure to develop pigment in the normally pigmented areas. This may result in complete albinism, when the pattern as well as the interspaces are white.","It does not confine itself to the forests, but prowls among villages, carrying off sheep, goats, dogs, and sometimes commits great depredations. It is very fearless, frequently seizing a dog in the middle of a village, whilst the inhabitants are still stirring. It always seizes its prey by the back of the neck or the throat. It is a particularly silent creature, very stealthy, and will contrive to dodge and hide itself in places where it would appear impossible that a creature of its size could find concealment. They are popularly said to be much in the habit of climbing trees. They are fearful of water, and will not readily swim, and are therefore rarely found on small islands. Like the Tiger, the Leopard will, if hungry, eat any dead carcass he can find. Leopards occasionally take to man-eating and, owing to their boldness, become even a more fearful scourge than tigers.

Leopards are solitary and secretive animals, and their behavior can vary based on their habitat and prey availability.

Elephas maximus,"The Asian Elephant (Elephas maximus) is a large and iconic elephant species native to various parts of Asia, including India. Known for their significance in culture and ecology, Asian elephants are an important and cherished species.","Asian elephants vary in size, with males being larger than females. On average, males can have a shoulder height of around 2.7 to 3.2 meters (8.9 to 10.5 feet) and a body length of about 5.5 to 6.4 meters (18 to 21 feet), excluding the trunk and tail. Females are generally smaller.","Skin nearly naked. Tail with a row of long coarse hairs for a few inches before and behind and round the end only. Five hoofs normally on each fore foot, four hoofs on each hind foot. The number of ridges in each molar from the first to the last is 4, 8, 12, 12, 16, and 24, with slight variation. Males as a rule have well developed tusks ; some males, known in India as makna, have merely short tusks like females. Colour blackish grey throughout. The forehead, base of the trunk, and the ears often mottled with flesh-colour. White elephants are albinoes. Head oblong, with a concave forehead ; crowns of the molars presenting narrow transverse ridges ; 4 toes to the hind-feet ; ears moderate; tusks large in the male, small in the female. Compared with the African elephant this species has much smaller ears. In the former the head is more rounded ; the grinders present broad lozenge-shaped eminences on their crowns ; and they have usually only 3 toes on their hindfeet. The number of pairs of ribs is, 19 in the Indian elephant, and 21 in the African, and there are 33 caudal vertebrre in tlie Indian, and never more than 26 in the African. In some males only one tusk is developed ; and in Ceylon many male elephants have the tusks very small.","The country chiefly inhabited by elephants is tree-forest, undulating or hilly, generally containing bamboos in considerable quantities, but the animals often enter the high grass growing on alluvial flats. Individuals of various sizes and ages, and of both sexes, associate in herds, usually numbering 30 to 50, but not uncommonly more, sometimes 100. These herds often break up temporarily into smaller groups. The males are frequently found alone, but as a rule each belongs to a herd and joins it occasionally. All members of a herd generally belong to the same family, and are nearly related : different herds do not mix, but stray females or young males appear to obtain admission to a herd without difficulty. The leader of a herd is invariably a female. According to Sanderson a really solitary elephant is rare, many "" rogue "" elephants that have become notorious belonging to a herd. As a general rule, wild elephants are most timorous, and shun the presence of man as carefully as deer do. Now and then considerable damage is done by wild elephants to various crops, and a single male individual at times becomes savage, and kills any one that comes in his way. The food of elephants consists principally of various kinds of grass, leaves and shoots of bamboos, wild plantains (Musa), of which both stems and leaves are eaten, and leaves, small branches, and bark of particular trees, especially of species of Ficus. A full-grown elephant consumes between 600 and 700 lb. of green fodder per diem. Elephants drink twice a day in general, before sunset and after sunrise. Both food and drink are conveyed to the mouth by the trunk ; tufts of grass or branches of trees are plucked by coiling the end of the trunk round them ; leaves are stripped from boughs, and even bark from trees or branches, in a similar manner; only very small objects, such as small fruits, are picked up between the lobes above and below the nostrils at the tip of the trunk. In drinking, the end of the trunk is immersed and the lower part (in Sanderson's opinion not more than 15 or 18 inches) filled by suction with water, which is then discharged into the mouth. Grain such as rice is eaten in a similar way, being drawn into the end of the trunk and then blown into the mouth. In the wild state elephants roam about and feed for the greater part of the day and night, resting from about 9 or 10 a.m. till about 3 P.M. and again from about 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. They lie down to sleep like other mammals. Whilst feeding the herds scatter somewhat, but they quickly collect when alarmed. In many places elephants migrate considerable distances at particular seasons, chiefly in search of fodder, but partly it is believed to avoid insects, and generally from higher to lower ground or vice versd, or from one kind of forest to another. In marching, they keep in strict Indian file. They are fond of bathing and of rolling in mud in warm weather. They squirt water on their bodies with their trunks when heated, and when water is not at hand they draw some, by means not clearly understood, from the mouth or throat. The fluid thus obtained is probably a secretion, perhaps salivary. They sometimes, especially when exposed to the sun, throw dust or leaves over their backs. The sense of smell is highly developed, but neither sight nor hearing is particularly acute. The only pace of elephants is a walk, slow or quick, at times increased to a shuffling run. They are incapable of any motion resembling a gallop, or of the least jump, vertical or horizontal. A 7-foot trench is impassable by them, though a large elephant can clear 6.5 feet in its stride. They climb very steep places, bending the fore legs when ascending and the hind legs when descending, and kicking or pressing holes for the feet if necessary. In kneeling down an elephant first bends the hind legs one after the other, then the fore legs, which are stretched out in front ; in rising the process is reversed. Few animals not aquatic by nature swim as well as elephants. They have been known to swim for six hours or even more without resting. The pace is not rapid, probably about a mile an hour. Tlie principal sounds made by elephants are the following. First the shrill trumpet, varying in tone, and expressive, sometimes of fear, sometimes of auger. Secondly a roar from the throat, caused by fear or pain. A peculiar hoarse rumbling in the throat may express anger or want, as when a calf is calling for its mother. Pleasure is indicated by a continued low squeaking through the trunk. Lastly, there is a peculiar metallic sound made by rapping the end of the trunk on the ground and blowing through it at the same time. This indicates alarm or dislike, and is the well known indication of a tiger's presence. An elephant sometimes tries to frighten its enemies by blowing through its trunk. Most elephants are timid inoffensive animals, though individuals are vicious ; females with young offspring and solitary males or "" rogues "" being most disposed to attack. The attack is made with the trunk tightly coiled, the feet, and in males the tusks, being used for purposes of offence, and the adversary, if caught, is generally trampled upon. The young are generally born in September, October, and November, though a few are produced at other seasons. Twins are a rare exception, a single young one the rule. The young when born is about 3 feet high and weighs about 200 lb. It sucks with the mouth, not with the trunk, which is short and but little flexible. An elephant is full grown, but not fully mature, at 25 years of age, and individuals have been known to live over 100 years in captivity ; in a wild state their existence probably extends to 150 years. Male elephants are liable to periodical attacks of excitement, supposed to be of a sexual nature, though this does not appear clearly proved. During such attacks the animals are said to be "" mast,"" and are often dangerous to men or to other elephants. The attack is preceded and accompanied by the flow of an oily secretion from a small orifice in each temple.","Asian elephants have a wide distribution across several Asian countries, including India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Thailand, and others. They inhabit a range of ecosystems, from forests to grasslands.","Asian elephants are well adapted to forested environments where they can find food, water, and cover. They are known to migrate between different habitat types based on seasonal changes.","The Asian Elephant is a megaherbivore, and is the only living species of the genus Elephas. It is smaller than the African Elephant and they are crepuscular in nature. Adult females and calfs move about in herds.

They generally drink between 8 and 10 o'clock in the morning, the time varying with the season of year, and repose during the day in deep shade. They swim well, and take readily to water. They both graze and browse. There is great irregularity as to the period of dropping the horns, and bucks with perfect antlers may be found at all seasons. The call of the spotted deer is a peculiar, loud, hoarse barking sound, easily recognized but difficult to describe. This deer also utters a shrill alarm cry.","Axis Deer are found in several countries in Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Southeast Asian countries.

In many individuals the ground colour appears to be fulvous with black pencilling, or mixed fulvous and black ; the longitudinal stripes then show dark ; limbs always dark-brown. Some appear almost black throughout, and the young are said to be nearly all black. Some appear fulvous- gray washed with black, the face black, and the tail very dark ; and others appear to have the sides spotted. Many of these variations are owing to the state of abrasion of the fur, which is yellowish at the base and blackish at the tip. Some have the abdomen marked with elongated white spots, and individuals occur with the tail spirally twisted, so that the extremity has the lower surface uppermost ; and, according to Blyth, it was an individual similar to this one which the genus was founded, and the name Paradoxus bestowed, which has been translated into Screw-tail.","It lives much on trees, especially on the Palmyra and cocoa-nut palms, and is often found to have taken up its residence in the thick thatched roofs of native houses.

The pale lateral band disappears in old males.","Open plains of short grass, level or undulating, and cultivated laiid are the usual haunts of the Indian antelope, which is generally found in herds ; these are sometimes extremely numerous, and comprise occasionally several thousand animals of both sexes and all ages ; but more often small herds of does, generally 10 to 30 in number, but sometimes as many as 50, are met with, attended by a single black buck, which does not always accompany the females. Very often two or three younger bucks coloured like the does remain with the latter ; but these young males are sometimes driven away by older bucks, and form separate herds. This antelope never enters forest nor high grass, and is but rarely seen amongst bushes. The Indian antelope appears to have no particular hours for feeding, though it generally rests in the middle of the day. The Indian antelope, has the habit of occasionally springing into the air, all the members of a herd generally bounding, one after the other. This is done, before they are much frightened, and when the herd is first moving off. When at speed the gallop is like that of any other animal. Occasionally these antelopes conceal themselves in grass or culti-vation, and wounded animals not unfrequently hide. Young fawns, too, are generally concealed by the mothers. The only sound the buck utter is a peculiar grunt that he makes when excited ; the females have a hissing alarm note, according to Forsyth. Like most other Indian antelopes, they deposit their dung repeatedly on the same spot. The rutting-season, says Mr. Elliot, commences about February or March, but fawns are seen of all ages at every season. During the spring months the buck often separates a particular doe from the herd, and will not suffer her to join it again, cutting her off and intercepting every attempt to mingle with the rest.

It keeps in thick jungle, only leaving the forest to graze on the skirts of the woods or in abandoned clearings. It has a wonderful way of getting through the thickest underwood, and it runs in a peculiar manner with its head low and its hind quarters high ; when not alarmed, as Colonel Hamilton observes, it steps "" daintily and warily, lifting each leg well above the grass or leaves."" The call of this species, from which the common name of ""barking deer"" is derived, is at a little distance very like a single bark from a dog, and is very loud for the size of the animal. It is often repeated at intervals, usually in the morning and evening, sometimes after dark, and in the cold weather, which is the rutting-season. It is uttered by the animal when alarmed, as well as when calling its mate. Elliot and Jerdon state that the tongue is very long and extensile, and this deer often licks the whole face with it. McMaster and Sterndale confirm this. When the buck is attacked by dogs it uses its canine teeth in defence and inflicts severe wounds with them. Colonel Hamilton has pointed out that these teeth are not fixed firmly in the jaw, but that the animal has some power of moving them. Several observers have noticed a peculiar rattling noice, like that produced by a pair of castanets, made by this deer when running, but the cause is not known.

The tiger usually takes up his abode for the day in deep shade, especially in the hot season, and in general near water under a dense bush or tree, in high green grass, or in thick low cover such as green rushes, tamarisk, or some of the other plants that grow in the beds of streams. The tigress is said to avoid the male when about to bring forth, and to hide her young from him ; but tigers are occasionally, though not often, seen accompanying tigresses and cubs. The young remain with the mother until nearly or quite full-grown ; and when more than two tigers are found consorting together, the party consists in general of a tigress and her full-grown offspring, the old tiger occasionally associating with his family also. The territory is marked with urine sprays and scrapes, onto trees, bushes and rock faces. Feaces and scrapes may also be left along trails. Mating occurs throughout the year. The gestation period is for four months and a normal litter size is two to three cubs. It is an ambush predator and usually hunts by night, with the chief prey consisting of deers and wild pigs. Their usual call is very similar to that of the lion, a prolonged moaning, thrilling sound, repeated twice or thrice, becoming louder and quicker, and ending with three or four repetitions of the last portion of it. Besides this, there is a peculiar loud ""woof"" produced when the animal is disturbed or surprised, a growl that it utters when provoked, and the well-known guttural sound of rage repeated two or three times when it charges. Tigers swim well and take readily to water, but rarely ascend trees, and appear quite incapable of climbing a vertical stem, large or small. hey have a habit, like cats, of scratching wood, and often show a predilection for the trunk of a particular tree, on which the marks of their claws may be seen up to a height of 10 or, it is said, 12 feet. The wild animals commonly eaten by tigers are pigs, deer of all kinds, nylgai, four-horned antelope, and porcupines. Peafowl may be slain at times and the same may be said of monkeys. Bears, though not often attacked, occasionally fall victims. Young gaur are occasionally killed, but the full-grown animal is more than a match for most tigers. Instances are said to have been known of even young elepliants being attacked, one such is mentioned by McMaster. In fact a hungry tiger will probably kill any other animal he can for food. He is said to have been observed catching and eating frogs ; and Mr. Simson found tigers in Eastern Bengal, during inundations, feeding upon fish, tortoises, crocodiles, and large lizards, and he once killed a tiger the pouch of which was crammed with grasshoppers or locusts. If an animal is struck down in the daytime, the body may be dragged some distance, but is usually left untouched till evening. At or soon after nightfall, or occasionally in quiet places before sundown, the tiger returns to the kill and, if the spot is open or otherwise unsuited for his repast, drags the body to a more convenient place. He almost always commences by eating the intestines and hindquarters. As a rule he remains near the kill, sometimes rushing out upon any intruder and driving away jackals, vultures, and other carrion-feeders ; but more often he hides the carcase under bushes or leaves, and retires to a neigh-bouring thicket beside water. If very hungry, a tiger will devour both hindquarters the first night. If undisturbed, he generally remains about three days near the carcase, feeding at intervals. Although tigers as a rule kill their own food, they do not disdain carrion","The Bengal Tiger's range historically included a significant portion of the Indian subcontinent, including India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and Myanmar. However, habitat loss and poaching have significantly reduced their distribution.","Tigers inhabit diverse habitats such as tropical rainforests, grasslands, mangrove swamps, and deciduous forests.

Semnopithecus ajax,"The Kashmir Gray Langur (Semnopithecus ajax), also known as the Himalayan Gray Langur or Kashmir Langur, is a species of langur found in the Himalayan regions of South Asia, including parts of India, Nepal, and Pakistan. Recognizable by its gray fur and distinct facial features, the Kashmir Gray Langur is known for its adaptation to mountainous and forested habitats.","Kashmir gray langurs are big monkeys, larger than other langur species. Males and females are both formidable in size, with a head-to-body length measurement of 26.4 in (67.1 cm) and an average weight of 39 lb (17.7 kg). A long tail that arcs over the back adds to their overall length.

Lifespan for this little-studied species has not been documented. Its cousin, the northern plains gray langur (whom scientists had once believed was a parent species to the Kashmir gray langur) is reported to live up to 30 years in captivity. In the wild, males don’t typically live past 18 year of age, while females live into their 30s.","These are striking primates, distinguished from other gray langur species by their immense size and darker-colored fore and hind limbs. The silvery-gray fur coat that cloaks their back and limbs is long and silky. In contrast, the chest and abdomen are dressed in white fur, with a hint of pale yellow. Dark eyes peer out from a hairless black face that is framed by a generous, “poofy,” silky white muffler that tries to conceal the monkey’s dark, hairless ears. Fingers are fitted with long, dark nails. The Kashmir gray langur’s long, nonprehensile tail, which it carries arched over its back and curved toward the head while walking on the ground, appears to have had the tip dipped in white paint, like an artist’s brush.","These are primates who are both terrestrial (spending time on the ground) and arboreal (spending time in the trees). Gray langurs move quadrupedally (on all four limbs) and are inclined to run, rather than walk, whether on the ground or moving through trees. On the ground, they sometimes alternate running with walking a few steps between their gait. In the trees, they assume an upright stance and leap horizontally 12–15 ft (3.7–4.6 m) as they travel from branch to branch. Descending leaps can be as much as 35–40 ft (10.7–12.2 m). Gray langurs are also known to hop bipedally (standing upright, hopping on the two rear limbs). And they are capable of swimming, if they must. One wildlife study reports that after several langurs accidentally fell into water, they swam to the safety of solid ground.

Kashmir gray langurs are diurnal, meaning they are active during daylight hours. Activity budget for a typical day is spent accordingly: feeding (39.8 percent), resting (29.2 percent), traveling (17.5 percent), grooming (9.5 percent), and huddling (3.2 percent), with other activities filling any gap. Wildlife researchers have observed significant differences in the amount of time spent by male, female, and juvenile langurs in social activities and feeding. Males appear to spend more time feeding and foraging than females, and juveniles spend the most time in social activity such as play. Playing is more than a casual, fun pastime: it serves to develop physical and behavioral development, along with helping to develop social bonds. Wildlife researchers observed no significant time differences spent resting and traveling among troop members.","The Chamba Valley of Himachal Pradesh, a mountainous state of northwestern India situated in the Western Himalayas, is home to the Kashmir gray langur (Semnopithecus ajax). Whether or not this leaf-eating monkey inhabits the region of Kashmir (one of the species’s namesakes) is uncertain.

 Alpha males use a ""roar"" when displaying against predators or threats. Infants use ""trilled-whistles"" as a signal of distress to their mothers when they are out of visual contact with them or if they need to be retrieved because they cannot descend a structure that they have climbed.
 Macaque mothers are the primary caregivers for their offspring, though all of the females in the group direct attention to infants and will approach, play with, carry, groom and protect them, especially if they are born to a high-ranking mother. By protecting a high-ranking female's infant, a lower-ranking female may expect rewards of tolerance and reduced aggression by the high-ranking female.","The range of the Stump-tailed Macaque includes parts of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and southern China.","This species ranges from tropical semi-evergreen forest to tropical wet evergreen forest and tropical moist deciduous forest.

They are typically grayish-brown in color and have a smooth, nearly hairless skin. Their forelimbs have evolved into flippers, which they use for swimming and maneuvering.","""Three independent immature sized dugongs were sighted. The first dugong was sighted on the south eastern side of Havelock Island (11056â€™-11059â€™N & 92056â€™-92059â€™E) and behavioural observations were made for 47h. The individual was approximately 2m long, with distinct scars on its body; an X-mark on its head, a line running back from the right pectoral, roughly circular marks above the left pectoral and on the underside of the base of the tail and 2 notches on the tail. It was observed feeding on seagrass (Halodule sp. and Halophila sp.) at an average depth of 6 m and at a maximum distance of 100m from the shore. It spent a mean period of 9.4 Â± 0.7h, n=15 a day feeding in an area of 0.1km2. The density of seagrass was sparse and the lengths of the shoots were less than 100mm. When feeding on these low growing sea grasses, the dugong dug into the bottom with its muzzle, extracting and consuming leaves, stems and interconnecting rhizomes. In this process, it reworked the upper 20-30mm of substrate raising clouds of fine sediment and leaving behind distinct long, serpentine feeding trails (Image 1). It surfaced at mean intervals of 231.8 Â± 13.5 s, n=22 (submergence time) to breathe at an angle of 450 exhaling once it reached the surface. The breathing pattern comprised of 2 short breaths at mean intervals of 31.1 Â± 6.0 s, n=22 followed by a longer third breath. The mean total surface time was 59.2 Â± 6.0 s, n=22. This was followed by an arching of the body and a forward roll which raised the mid-dorsal region and then the tail above the surface giving a downward thrust. The descent was generally at a steeper angle and on reaching the bottom; the dugong supported itself on its pectorals without the body actually touching the sea bed. The pectorals were also used for locomotion on the bottom.
The second dugong was sighted around Neil Island (11049â€™-11050â€™N & 93000â€™-93Â°02â€™E) and behavioural observations were made for 54h. It was approximately 2.5m long, had a distinct crescent scar on the left side above the pectoral, a notch on the inner side of the left and right pectoral and the left side of the tail and a scar running along the lower half of the trunk. It was observed feeding on Halodule sp. and Halophila sp. at an average depth of 9m, and at a maximum distance of 100m from the shore during the neap tide. While feeding, it surfaced at mean intervals of 268.4 Â± 14.6 s, n=41 and spent a mean period of 2.9 Â±0.8 h, n=36 a day feeding. During the spring tide it was observed idling and resting at this site (Image 2). While idling, it swam at an average depth of 3m and up-to a distance of 300m from the shore. It moved with the help of its tail and surfaced at mean intervals of 326.1 Â± 11.8 s, n=29 and spent a mean period of 4.1 Â±0.8 h, n=14 a day idling. While resting, it remained close to the surface without any movement and closed its eyes. It was observed resting for a mean period of 1.2 Â±0.3 h, n=4. While idling and resting, it just submerged while moving forward without arching and rolling. It was observed communicating in the form of long squeaks. Both the dugongs sometimes had 1-2 remoras attached posteriorly and ventrally to their bodies and were always preceded by juvenile pilot fish. The third dugong was sighted at Kodiaghat (11031â€™49.25â€™â€™N & 92043â€™36.68â€E) in south Andaman and was observed for a brief period of 590 s at a depth of 7m. It was approximately 3m long and it showed observer directed behaviour. It curiously approached us and stopped at a distance of 2m from us. It then circled us twice surfacing to breathe between each circling. It followed the similar breathing pattern of two short breaths and a third long breath. All three individuals were identified as males and confirmation of the sex was done by an observation of the genital parts.""","Dugongs are found in the warm coastal waters and tropical seas of the Indo-Pacific region. Their range extends from the eastern coast of Africa to the western Pacific Ocean, including regions such as the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, and northern Australia.","Dugongs inhabit various coastal and nearshore habitats, including seagrass meadows, mangrove areas, and coral reefs.
